### LAMMPS KA mixture deformation scripts ###
### Davide Fiocco, EPFL, 2013. e-mail: davide.fiocco@outlook.com ###

The LAMMPS scripts provided here are nested all into batch.in, that allows to perform repeated oscillatory deformation of a given sample (whose name is set to be restart-XXX in batch.in, where XXX is a number) up to a specified amplitude.

The structure of the nested scripts (nested using the include and jump instructions of LAMMPS) is as follows:

batch.in loops over semicycles:
	aqs.in (represents a deformation semicycle, which in turn consists of a forward shear and backshear (or backward and forward shear)) loops over:
		shear.in
		backshear.in
		
The configurations of zero-strain visited in the simulation are saved in the XYZ format in the directory aqsdeformation. A full configuration is saved in a LAMMPS binary file at the end of the simulation.

The parameters of the simulations are contained in the file parameters.in and briefly commented therein.

The scripts have been tested to work on the version of LAMMPS (28 Feb 2012)
